    <h1>Game Mechanics</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            An A.I will be given a single process on the competition server to
            run on
        </li>
        <li>
            Each time an A.I gains priority it will have 5 seconds to make
            computations and send actions. If it fails to pass priority in that
            time, it will lose the game
        </li>
        <li>
            If an A.I sends an illegal action to the server, or an action which
            causes the game process to throw an exception it will lose the game
        </li>
    </ol>

            human player of the game. However, they may remember previously seen
            information or make inferences.

            Any bugs in the gameâ€™s code must be reported to the tournament

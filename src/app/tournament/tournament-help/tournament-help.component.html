        <b>Important:</b> There will be an online discord information session on

    <p>
        The goal of this competition is to create the strongest possible AI
        player (bot) for the collectible card game Fifth Aeon. Fifth Aeon is a
        CCG that resembles well known games such as Magic the Gathering, and it
        can be played in a browser at https://fifthaeon.com/.
    </p>

    <p>
        To compete in the tournament, contestants will form teams of 1-4 people
        and create a bot using a tool called the Bot Tool Kit (BTK). There is a
        prebuilt and fully functional bot called DefaultAI which contestants may
        use as a starting point, thereby allowing competitors of all skill
        levels to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a pool of prizes available for the winning teams, which
        consists of Amazon gift cards and Steam keys.
